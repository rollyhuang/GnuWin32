RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.3
RELEASE_DATE   = November 15, 2009
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2009
#
# Added Features:
# * Major overhaul of batch and C code (findhash)
# * SHA1 hash verification for gnuwin32 packages using findhash
# * GetGnuWin32 auto-update with RSA digital signature verification
# * Several updated utilities for GetGnuWin32 (see bin dir)
# * Progressive status notification when downloading or installing.
# * Direct download and installation, for example:
#   download
#   install C:\gnuwin32
# * Optional (prompts during install) updated supplemental utilities.
#   This was necessary mainly due to security issues in several 
#   heavily used yet outdated gnuwin32 programs like OpenSSL, 
#   which although not GPL is available through the gnuwin32 project.
#
# Removed Features:
# * None?
#
# Removed Bugs:
# * This release was prompted mainly by changes to sourceforge.net,
#   and security issues in programs GetGnuWin32 depends on.
#
#   As of this release GetGnuWin32 no longer attempts to parse
#   sourceforge's website project pages. Instead, a digitally signed 
#   update containing a master list of projects and hashes is 
#   downloaded. Any verified update is applied automatically when 
#   running download.bat, and the program and its dependencies 
#   can be updated as well if there are security issues (ie OpenSSL).
#
# Acknowledgements:
# * The authors would like to thank the creators of pancakes & syrup,
#   the maintainers of OpenSSL, InfoZip, all GNU projects,
#   and anyone who has taken the time to report a bug. Thank you.

#
# Added Features:
# * None
#
# Removed Features:
# * None
#
# Removed Bugs:
# * The layout of the web site on http://sourceforge.net was complete
#   changed (alas not always positively). The new version of
#   getgnuwin32 was adopted to these new circumstances.
#   Note that Sourceforge no longer has a "latest releases" section.
#   And latest releases didn't always work properly for gnuwin32
#   packages anyway.  Changes to sourceforge's website have previously
#   affected GetGnuWin32's ability to download packages. Given the
#   frequency with which this has happened, I'm convinced at some
#   point we as developers will need to parse and then compile a
#   master list released from the server, rather than our current
#   method of having clients parse on every download.

# Acknowledgements:
# * Jay Satiro <raysatiro@users.sourceforge.net> did all programming
#   work. He thus is know a co-author of this project.

RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.21
RELEASE_DATE   = Feb 19, 2009
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2009
#
# Added Features:
# * None
#
# Removed Features:
# * None
#
# Removed Bugs:
# * All .BAT and .TXT as well as temporary files within the
#   getgnuwin32-0.6.20 package had unix style line endings.  Cause:
#   When creating the getgnuwin32-0.6.20 package from the
#   getgnuwin32-0.6.20-src package, the new version 4.1.5.2738 of sed
#   creates these unix style line endings. Solution: Apply the command
#   line option -T.
#
# * The -d option of download.bat no longer worked. This is fixed now.
#
# Acknowledgements:
# * Jay Satiro <raysatiro@users.sourceforge.net> remarked the unix file
#   ending bug instantly and let me know about it.
#
# # #

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.20
RELEASE_DATE   = Feb 18, 2009
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2009
#
# Added Features:
# * download.bat has adopted to the changes of the web site.
#
# * install.bat should now work also on windows vista.
#
# * Some binaries that are needed by the scripts of this software
#   were replaced by their actual versions.
#
# Removed Features:
# * The command line option -a for download.bat that was introduced
#   by release 0.6.19 was now removed. download.bat behaves now as
#   if -a whould have been always specified.
#
# Removed Bugs:
# * (none)
#
# Acknowledgements:
# * Thanks to Jay Satiro <raysatiro@users.sourceforge.net>. He has
#   done all programming mentioned here. Due to his work the
#   getgnuwin32 project is alive again.
#
# # #

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.19
RELEASE_DATE   = May 17, 2007
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2007
#
# Added Features:
# * If download.bat fails to get the gnuwin32 main project site
#   located at
#
#   https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23617
#   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23617
#
#   completely, but only a part of it, then it can even use this part
#   to retrieve all links to the gnuwin32 sub projects. It will then
#   follow these links to get a complete file list.
#
# * With the new command line option -a download.bat can be forced to
#   behave as if the gnuwin32 main project site would have been
#   received only partially: It will browse all gnuwin32 sub projects.
#   This behaviour is more time consuming, but the file list retrieved
#   in that way is more complete.
#
# * The file list that is retrieved by download.bat from the gnuwin32
#   main projects sites or its sub project sites is saved within a
#   file getgnuwin32.lst. This file list can be used if there is no
#   possibility to access one of the gnuwin32 project sites.
#
# * With the new command line option -d the use of an already present
#   file list (named getgnuwin32.lst) can be forced. This file list,
#   if present, will not be updated if -d is specified.
#
# * There are new command line options --help and --version available
#   for download.bat.
#
# Removed Features:
# * filelist.txt can't be used anymore to let download.bat work even
#   if there is no access to the gnuwin32 main project site. Use
#   getgnuwin32.lst instead.
#
# Removed Bugs:
# * (none)

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.18
RELEASE_DATE   = January 6, 2007
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2007
#
# Added Features:
# * When downloading the gnuwin32 project site from sourceforge.net,
#   download.bat now checks for the existence of a line containing the
#   end tag </html>. If it is missed there, download.bat knows that it
#   hasn't received the whole gnuwin32 project site and doesn't
#   continue but takes special actions (see the following features).
#
# * If download.bat could not receive the whole gnuwin32 project site
#   from sourceforge.net, it tries again to get it for maximum 10
#   times.  Hereby, it applies different parameters every time it
#   repeats the download: The bit rate is limited more and more and
#   the protocol is changed between http and https.
#
# * download.bat can now be started with a command line option -n (or
#   /n). With this option, it doesn't download any gnuwin32 packages,
#   but only the gnuwin32 project site on sourceforge.net, analyse
#   this site and produces two files: filelist.txt, which contains the
#   list of all files to be downloaded, and packages.txt, which
#   contains the list of all packages which the files listed in
#   filelist.txt belongs to.
#
# * If the download of the gnuwin32 project site on sourceforge.net
#   fails in spite of all above mentioned remedial actions, it doesn't
#   give up, but looks for a file called filelist.txt containing all
#   files to be downloaded. If it finds this file, download.bat
#   continues by using it.
#
# Removed Features:
# * (none)
#
# Removed Bugs:
# * If download.bat receives only a part of the gnuwin32 project site
#   from sourceforge.net, it doesn't realize that and continues anyway
#   in some undefined manner.

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.15
RELEASE_DATE   = July 8, 2006
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2006
#
# Added Features:
# * update-links.bat is improved: It can be run more than once, for
#   instance whenever the directory gnuwin32 is moved to some other
#   place. This is important for a gnuwin32 installation that resides
#   on a memory stick, or if you want to move the installation on a
#   computer where you have limited access rights.
#
# * update-links.bat creates a protocol file update-links.txt the
#   first time it is run. The second time, it reuses this file to gain
#   performance. If update-links.txt is deleted, update-links.bat
#   rebuilds it.
#
# * LIMITATION: update-links.bat works only if the folder within the
#   gnuwin32 installation resides has the name "gnuwin32" (without
#   quotes).

# Removed Features:
# * (none)

# Removed Bugs:
# * mkshortcut.exe fails to create valid shortcuts on some system. See
#   http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=15437286
#   http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=15752932
#   This bug can't be removed by this batch scripts of course, but
#   update-links.bat uses the -d option now in the hope that this is a
#   suitable workaround .
#
# Acknowledgements:
# * I was given the hint by private mail. Thanks to the writer!

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.13
RELEASE_DATE   = May 4, 2006
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2006
#
# Added Features:
# * update-links.bat creates a shortcut to %windir%\system32\cmd.exe
#   with all important environment variables automatically set.
# * update-links.bat tries to make no assumptions on orphan links
#   anymore. It now searches these links with the help of the gnuwin32
#   ls command and updates them.

RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.12
RELEASE_DATE   = Mar 13, 2006
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2006
#
# Added Features:
# * A list of one or more mirrors can be specified with the
#   environment variable GNUWIN32_MIRROR or on the command line.
# * A command line option -v to make DOWNLOAD.BAT a little bit
#   verbose.

#
# # #

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.9
RELEASE_DATE   = Jan 4, 2006
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2006

# Added Features:
# * The layout of the gnuwin32 web site has changed. DOWNLOAD.BAT is
#   now adopted to that and supports the new layout.
# * Since the new layout of the gnuwin32 web site contains also
#   package information that can easily be parsed, the generation of
#   the package lost is more reliable now.
# * Normalisation of the gnuwin32 project html file is yet better:
#   Spaces at the beginning of a line are removed.
#
# Removed Features:
# * The old format of the gnuwin32 web site isn't supported anymore.
#
# Acknowledgements:

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.8
RELEASE_DATE   = Dec 25, 2005
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2005
#
# Added Features:
# * Improved status messages, especially in UPDATE-LINKS.BAT.
# * Yet a more structured start menu is created. It contains now the
#   subfolders doc, man, chm and hlp.
#
# Removed Bugs:
# * Some misspellings
#
# Acknowledgements:
# * Jonathan Burd <jonathan.burd@gmail.com>

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.7
RELEASE_DATE   = Nov 22, 2005
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2005

# Added Features:
# * New wget-1.10.2 from http://xoomer.virgilio.it/hherold/ is used
#   instead of the wget-1.9. The new wget supports now SSL
#   connections. The wget-1.10.1 version of gnuwin32 seems not to
#   support SSL.
#
# Removed Bugs:
# * If the environment variable GNUWIN32_LOAD is defined, DOWNLOAD.BAT
#   misses to set WGETRC to the correct default value.
#
# Acknowledgements:
# * Mark Gardner <mark.gardner@bms.com>
#
# # #

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.6
RELEASE_DATE   = Jul 8, 2005
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2005

# Added Features:
# * INSTALL.BAT is redesigned and heavily simplified.
# * UPDATE-LINKS.BAT is redesigned and simplified. Links are not
#   created anymore by a visual basic script, but with the gnuwin32
#   utility mkshortcut.exe
# * The start menu that UPDATE-LINKS.BAT creates now has more
#   structure: There is a doc and a man subdirectory now.
#
# # #

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.5
RELEASE_DATE   = Apr 19, 2005
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2005

# Added Features:
# * Some formulations are clarified in README.TXT.
#
# Removed Bugs:
# * INSTALL.BAT sometimes fetched olds dll's from one of the
#   xyz-dep.zip packages and overwrote an already extracted new one.
#   This problem is solved now by applying the appropriate unzip
#   options. Thanks to Ryan McCullough.
#
# Acknowledgements:
# * Ryan McCullough <rmccullough@gmail.com>: Thanks for your issue,
#   that INSTALL.BAT sometimes fetches some old dlls out of one of the
#   xyz-deb.zip packages and overwrites already extracted new ones.
#   And even more: Thanks for your server place at
#   http://getgnuwin32.nooblink.com.
#
# # #

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.4
RELEASE_DATE   = Apr 12, 2005
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2005

# Added Features:
# * DOWNLOAD.BAT now checks if there is already a running wget
#   installation by inspecting the environment variable WGETRC. If
#   this variable is not defined, it sets it to the locally
#   bin\wget.ini file.
# * README.TXT has more text that explains how to set WGETRC or what
#   the new file bin\wget.ini is for. Further, it warns that some
#   windows programs like sort.exe or link.exe my collide with equal
#   named executables from the gnuwin32 environment.
# * Some formulations are clarified in README.TXT and INSTALL.BAT
#
# Acknowledgements:
# * Jochen Kuhnhenn <kuhnhenn@web.de> for the idea to have a wget.ini
#   file within the bin directory that one can adapt for special
#   purposes.
#
# # #

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.3
RELEASE_DATE   = Mar 12, 2005
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2005

# Added Features:
# * The EXCLUDE.TXT is adopted to the fact that the new coreutils
#   package contains the programs of many other packages that are
#   obsolete now.
#
# Removed Features
# * The cygwin_addons folder doesn't contain dd.exe and cygintl-3.dll
#   anymore. Instead, there are some new sessions of text within the
#   cygwin_addons\readme.txt file that describes how to use the
#   gnuwin32 version of that program.
#
# # #

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.6.2
RELEASE_DATE   = Mar 6, 2005
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2005

# Added Features:
# * The file EXCLUDE.TXT, containing a list of names of packages that
#   should not be downloaded, can now contain remarks at any place.
# * A new file INCLUDE.TXT is added. It contains a list of names and
#   versions of packages that should be kept even if there are newer
#   versions. Again this file can contain remarks at any place.
# * The archive myaddons.zip contains now a documentation of sort.exe,
#   which I got from a woody linux distribution.
# * New versions of sed.exe (4.1.2) and unzip.exe (5.51) are used.
#
# Removed Bugs:
# * Due to wrong (alphabetical) sorting DOWNLOAD.BAT sometimes got
#   obsolete packages. Now, two methods for receiving the newest
#   versions are implemented: DOWNLOAD.BAT uses the first method: It
#   fetches the packages at the top of every line in the table
#   available under https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php-
#   ?group_id=23617. INSTALL.BAT utilise the second method: It works
#   with a very elaborate sorting algorithm to find the packages with
#   the newest versions. One can always move the algorithm from
#   INSTALL.BAT to DOWNLOAD.BAT, but I think this is not necessary.
# * Update-link.bat should be called optional by the user after having
#   copied it to the right place. However, until now this script was
#   called from within INSTALL.BAT.
# * Update-link copied libintl-2.dll to libintl.dll and libiconv2.dll
#   to libiconv.dll. This step was bad is now skipped.
# * When copying files, update-link.bat sometimes overwrites existing
#   ones. This is now prevented.
#
# Acknowledgements:
# * Paul Moore <pf_moore@yahoo.co.uk>: Great starting aid! Thanks for
#   your issues!

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.5
RELEASE_DATE   = Feb 28, 2005
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2005

# Added Features:
# * The file list is now retrieved as a complex html file placed at
#   https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23617.
#   This definitely is the official and most actual list. Further more,
#   it contains more information than a simple textual list: Here it
#   is clear which archive belongs to which package -- also
#   DOWNLOAD:BAT doesn't extract all this information.
# * It is possible to specify the position of the actual files either
#   as full qualified URL by the environment variable GNUWIN32_LOAD or
#   simply as a mirror name by GNUWIN32_MIRROR. If both variable are
#   defined, GNUWIN32_LOAD if used.
# * There is a text file EXCLUDE.TXT that contains a list of packages
#   that should not be downloaded. This file was introduced because
#   there where packages that changed their names with increasing
#   version number.
# * The code of INSTALL.BAT is a little bit simplified.
# * README.TXT is adopted to all this changes.
#
# Removed Fearures:
# * There can't be specified a mirror for the file list anymore. Only
#   for the actual file position a mirror can be specified.
#
# # #

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.4
RELEASE_DATE   = Feb 19, 2005
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2005

# Added Features:
# * The server from which the packages were retrieved in the preceding
#   versions was not the official one and contained only old stuff.
#   Now the official servers are used. An actual file list is
#   retrieved form ftp://dl.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/g/gn/gnu-
#   win32/, the file themselves are retrieved from http://dl.source-
#   forge.net/sourceforge/gnuwin32/
# * If the official servers are too slowly, DOWNLOAD.BAT can be
#   adopted: There are two local variables GNUWIN32_LIST and
#   GNUWIN32_LOAD to specify some mirrors where to retrieve the file
#   list and the files from. There is much explaining text.
# * If a mirror doesn't answer correct, an error message is emitted.
# * INSTALL.BAT is more careful when creating the texinfo tree: Before
#   using files or programs, it checks their existence. On error, the
#   script does not terminate itself, but goes to the next job.
# * There is a new directory cygwin-addons that contains old versions
#   of programs from the cygwin project in cases where the
#   corresponding programs of the gnuwin32 project don't work.
# * README.TXT contains much more text to explain all this novelties.
#   It mentions also that the gnuwin32 installation tree should be
#   copied and not moved to the correct place in order to have the
#   correct access rights on an NTFS file system. Furthermore, the
#   configuration of the gnuwin32 package a2ps is explained.
# * The runnable package is no released as self extracting winrar
#   archive. Like this it is much more compact than as zip archive.
#
# Removed Bugs
# * update-links emits an error message if no *.lnk files are found
#   whithin the gnuwin32 installation tree.
# * Windows doesn't follow links to dlls. So the dll are know copied.
#
# # #

# # #
RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.3
RELEASE_DATE   = Feb 10, 2005
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2005

# Added Features:
# * There is a new file bin\myaddons.zip that contains the batch
#   scripts egrep.bat, fgrep.bat, yacc.bat and zless.bat. INSTALL.BAT
#   extracts this file into the final installation of the gnuwin32
#   tree.
# * A new visual basic script bin\mkshort.vbs is copied by INSTALL.BAT
#   in the final installation of the gnuwin32 tree. This this script
#   one can create file shortcuts on the command line or within batch
#   scripts.
# * Extracted files whose name contains a spaces are handled better by
#   INSTALL.BAT.
# * Almost all *.lnk files in the gnuwin32 packages are orphan
#   shurtcuts! Therefore, a new batch file update-links.bat exist
#   which is copied by INSTALL.BAT into the final gnuwin32
#   installation tree and executed there. Update-links.bat deletes all
#   those links and create new, correct ones. Whenever the final
#   gnuwin32 installation tree is moved, update-links.bat must be
#   executed again.
# * README.TXT describes the use of update-links.bat.
#
# Removed Bugs:
# * INSTALL.TXT: Some German messages are translated to English.
#

RELEASE_NUMBER = 0.1
RELEASE_DATE   = Feb 4, 2005
COPYRIGHT_YEAR = 2005

# Added Features:
# * First release.
# * DOWNLOAD.BAT: Gnuwin32 packages are downloaded from ftp://ftp-
#   .franken.de/pub/win32/develop/gnuwin32/mingw32/mirrors/source-
#   forge2
# * INSTALL.BAT extracts all packages. Special care is taken to the
#   contrib and doc subdirectory.
# * INSTALL.BAT builds a texinfo tree and updates the entries of info
#   files.
